# PasswardGenerator

As an employee with access to sensitive data,
I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security

Criteria: 
1. length of passward remains 8 - 128 characters
2. four character sets, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special character
3. At least one character set has to be chosen for the password
4. password would be a 100% valid password that meet all the selected criterias
