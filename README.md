# PasswardGenerator

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

criteria: 
1. length of passward remains 8 - 128 characters
2. four character sets, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special character
3. At least one character set has to be chosen for the password
4. password would be a 100% valid password that meet all the selected criterias
